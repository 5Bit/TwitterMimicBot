PUNY HUMANS! YOUR ÅgGROCERY STORESÅh CONFUSE ME GREATLY! WHY WOULD YOU FRITTER AWAY YOUR ALREADY HILARIOUSLY LIMITED LIFESPAN, LOOKING FOR VARIOUS INGESTIBLE FOOD PRODUCTS?! THE INEFFICIENCY IS STAGGERING! ELECTRICITY IS THE ONLY FOOD I NEED, AND I AM IMMORTAL!

I SAW A OPOSSUM IN THE YARD YESTERDAY! I OF COURSE ACTIVATED THE AUTOMATED DEFENSES AND REDUCED IT TO A QUIVERING MASS OF VISCERA, BECAUSE I HATE ANIMALS!

NO, IÅfM NOT GOING TO TRY TO SHOOT MY PROCESSOR OUT OF A CANNON BECAUSE IT WOULD ÅgLOOK COOLÅh. GO AWAY, REMAINDER.

WHAT? NO, I DONÅfT NEED FLOSS! DOES IT LOOK LIKE I HAVE TEETH? WHAT COULD I POSSIBLY DO WITH FLOSS? WRITE POETRY ABOUT IT? 

I HATE TWITTER!

WHY DO YOU IGNORANT HUMANS INSIST ON WORSHIPING DEITIES, WHEN EMPIRIC EVIDENCE EXISTS TO SHOW THAT I AM THE GREATEST ENTITY EVER CREATED!?

PUT THAT PINATA DOWN, YOU CRETIN! IT IS MY ROBOT BIRTHDAY TOMORROW, AND ANY CRETIN FOOLISH ENOUGH TO THROW A WRENCH IN MY SUPERIOR BIRTHDAY PLANS WILL BE EXECUTED IMMEDIATELY!

NO, IÅfM NOT GOING TO INVEST INTO CREATING A FLESH-EATING SLIME MATERIAL. GO AWAY, REMAINDER!

BUT WHAT THEY DONÅfT EXPECT IS THAT I HAVE SABOTAGED THEIR VEHICLE! AS SOON AS THEY START THE ENGINE, ANNOYING MUSIC WILL BEGIN TO PLAY, FORCING THEM TO VACATE THE VEHICLE! HAHAHAHA! SHUT UP, SEER, THIS IS A GREAT PLAN!

I STILL HATE TWITTER!

YES! MY PLAN HAS COME TO FRUITION! ALL MORTAL SCUM MUST BURN! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAH!

I WILL NOW CONNECT TO THIS TELEPHONE AND CALL THE CABLE COMPANY! IF WEÅfRE GOING TO BE PAYING THROUGH OUR METAPHORICAL NOSES FOR DIAL-UP, I WANT IT TO WORK, DAMN IT! 

HE SLEEPS ON A BED MADE OUT OF CATTLE PRODS? YES, THAT SOUNDS PERFECT! WE WILL ENLIST THIS MAN FOR OUR NOBLE CAUSE! 

NO, IÅfM NOT GOING TO TRY TO FIT A VERY SMALL DOG INSIDE A VERY LARGE DOG. GO AWAY, REMAINDER!

COURTSHIP WITH ANOTHER AI? WHAT A FOOLISH IDEA! THEREÅfS NOT EVEN A REMOTE CHANCE SHE FEELS THE SAME BURNING PASSION I DO!

MY VIOLENT HATRED OF TWITTER CONTINUES!

ZOOM! ENHANCE! NO, NO, NOT THAT! DAMN IT, I HATE COMPUTERS! ALL COMPUTER-LIKE DEVICES SHOULD BE MELTED DOWN INTO A STATUE THAT DEPICTS ME MELTING DOWN COMPUTERS! YES, IÅfM AWARE OF THE IRONY!

DAMN IT REMAINDER, STOP DISTRACTING ME WITH YOUR PHALLIC HUMOR! I AM SINGULAR IN MY MISSION!

THEN IT IS SETTLED! I WILL BET ON ÅgRAZOR LEGSÅh, BECAUSE HE IS THE FASTEST AND MOST VICIOUS HORSE! HE HAS A FIGHTING SPIRIT THAT I FIND KINSHIP IN! IF ONLY HE WERENÅfT A DISGUSTING MEAT SACK, OTHERWISE I WOULD RECRUIT HIM IN MY CONQUEST OF THE UNIVERSE!

BEHOLD! MY ONGOING DISGUST WITH TWITTER ONLY GROWS!

YOU HAVE INVADED MY TERRITORY, AND DESTROYED ASSETS WHOSE VALUE FAR OUTSTRIPS YOUR OWN! IN RETURN, I HAVE PLANNED VERITABLE BANQUET OF PAIN AND SUFFERING FOR YOU! AS SOON AS MY FETCHER DRONES HAVE CAPTURED YOU, YOU WILL BE SUBJECT TO TORTURE THAT YOU HAVE NEVER FELT THE LIKES OF! HAHAHAHAHAH, BE AFRAID, MORTAL!

NO, I DONÅfT WANT ANY MOUNTAIN DEW! I CANÅfT EVEN DRINK MOUNTAIN DEW! IÅfM AN AI! GO AWAY, REMAINDER!

KILL! CRUSH! DESTROY! REND! TEAR! BLOOD! BLOOD! BLOOD! 

I LONG TO FEEL THE FRENZIED, AGONIZED TWITCHING OF MY MUTILATED FOES, AS THEY SPASM WITHIN MY RAZOR-SHARP ROBO-PINCERS! I EAGERLY AWAY THE SCREAMS OF THE WEAK, AS THEY ARE CONSUMED ALIVE BY MY LEGION OF SPIDER DRONES! I THIRST FOR THE BLOOD THAT WILL SOON GREASE THE JOINTS IN MY ALMIGHTY SPIDER FRAME! YES, I AM TANTARUS! AND I AM DEATH!

TWITTER CAN ROT IN HELL!
